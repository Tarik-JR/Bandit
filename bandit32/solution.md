INSTRUCTION:

After all this git stuff, itâ€™s time for another escape. Good luck!

Commands you may need to solve this level
sh, man

SOLUTION:

after loggin in, we get a shell that apparently does not allow us to run any command and it prints out, "Permission Denied " everytime we try a command.

KNOWLEDGE:

a shell is a command interpreter, we have explained it earlier before.
